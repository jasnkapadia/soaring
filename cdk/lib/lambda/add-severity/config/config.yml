# You can manually set the weightings used for severity calculations

# All weightings are added together and if they exceed the baseline
# an alert is sent.

# You can assign severity to usage patterns here
# The pattern matchers are defined in ./patterns.yml
# The severity of top-level patterns are added together to determine
# whether they exceed the alerting baseline. Cofactors raise the severity of top-level patterns.
